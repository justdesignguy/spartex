                <p>Fabric Order Policy</p>
                <p>Although we take every step necessary to assure accurate representation of items displayed online, please understand that the photos provided may not fully represent the true color or nature of a particular item. Due to this discrepancy, we recommend you to request a sample before purchasing fabrics from our online store.</p>
                <h2>Caution:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>It cannot be guaranteed</strong> that the samples and the actual product will be the exact same <strong>color and thickness</strong> due to <strong>batch-to-batch variations.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>It cannot be guaranteed</strong> that each yard is exactly 91.4 cm. Since we cannot make refunds for differences less than 10 cm per yard for orders less than 10 yards, it is advised to order <strong>at least 1 yard extra</strong> just in case.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Fabric Order Refund Policy:</h2>
                <p><strong>Refunds are not permitted after fabric goods have been cut. All sales are final.</strong></p>
                <p>If you realize that you have made a mistake after placing an order and you wish to make changes, please email us immediately referencing your order number. We will do our best to satisfy your request, but only on the condition that the fabrics of your order have not been cut.</p>
                <p>Be sure to run advance tests with a swatch or small portion of yardage before laundering/manufacturing full yardages to avoid damaging the goods. Washing and management methods can change depending on the characteristics of fabric or finished garments. We do not accept responsibility for fabrics that are incorrectly laundered/damaged by poorly handling products.</p>
                <p><strong>All refunds will be issued to whatever payment method that the payer initially used to make the payment.</strong></p>
                <h3>Return / Exchange Policy</h3>
                <p>We will exchange your fabrics in the unlikely event that you have received fabrics which are damaged, defective or incorrect. If this is the case, please email us immediately (support@spartexglobal.com) within 5 days of receiving your goods. Color differences due to lot-to-lot-variations does not count as defective or incorrect. We will notify you regarding lot-to-lot variations beforehand if there is a large difference, but we are not obligated to do so. Short yardages less than 10 cm per yard does not count as defective or incorrect for order less than 10 yards.</p>
                <p><strong>You will need to comply with the following return/exchange policies:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Products must be returned in the same condition as received and sent back in their original packaging.</li>
                    <li>Products must not be washed, ironed or altered in any way.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Return/exchange procedure:</h3>
                <p>Email us (support@spartexglobal.com) including the order number, and the product number you wish to claim for a return/exchange.</p>
                <p>After receiving authorization to return/exchange products, you will need to send us the fabrics within 10 days of receiving your order. Please scan the shipment receipt and send via email. Once we receive the fabrics, we will refund the shipping cost to your Paypal account.</p>
                <h3>DIGITAL PRINTING POLICY</h3>
                <p><strong>Color Differences</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Colors printed on the physical fabric will slightly vary between what you see on your computer monitor depending on monitor settings.</li>
                    <li>Inevitable batch-to-batch dye variations may occur due to weather, humidity, etc.</li>
                    <li>Spartex will not be responsible for color differences.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Shrinkage and print imperfections</h3>
                <p>Check the shrinkage rate per fabric</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Shrinkage caused by applying digital print varies by fabric to fabric (1~5%).</li>
                    <li>Details can be found in each base fabric offered for print.</li>
                    <li>Depending on the shrinkage rate, order extra yardages.</li>
                    <li>Consider print imperfections in the "cut edges" of each yardage roll.</li>
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    <li>Due to the printer settings and print process, you may get irregular/imperfect results in the edges of each fabric roll.</li>
                    <li>These irregularities will result within 1 yard on both edges of each roll.</li>
                    <li>Order 1 extra yard per roll or cut, just in case.</li>
                    <li>Spartex is not responsible for shrinkage and imperfections within 1 yard on each edges of each roll</li>
                </ol>
